Before the Helper Plugin enable [Screenshot](https://prnt.sc/sqqgan)

Notation:
1. Though there is no way to make the .htaccess/wp-config.php file writable from the helper plugin so I will inform the user to make the htaccess file writeable from the cPanel/FTP first. Then will go for the 2nd option.
2. If the the files are not writeable and shows [these errors](https://prnt.sc/sqqgan) then upon activating the plugin it will disable the WP_CACHE (page cache) and hide the [error message warning](https://prnt.sc/sqqqse) from the wp-admin dashboard.

Cheers & enjoy!
